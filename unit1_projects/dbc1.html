	<h1>Joseph Thomas Xavier Hendele</h1>

	<h2>Hometown: Chicago</h2>
	<p>Between the skyscrapers, the politics, the weather, and the sports, I've seen it all in <span class="greenboldtext">Chicago</span>. Born and raised in the city of wind (Lincoln Park, to be exact!), I knew nothing but harsh winters and humid summers growing up. I used to think that everyone experienced below zero temps and were accustomed to <p id="background">barreling down slushy streets in the dead of winter.</p> Thankfully, I retreated to the University of Oregon for college and while I escaped the brutal cold, I was introduced to my new friend, rain! </p>
	<p>After Oregon, I moved to Washington, DC for grad school and exchanged my flannel shirts for bow ties and button downs. The streets became narrower, the sky a little more limited, and the summer infinitely more HUMID. I had to adjust immediately. After a year at Georgetown and others working in Sports Management, I became a true resident of DC.</p>
