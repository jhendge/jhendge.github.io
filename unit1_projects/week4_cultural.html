    <h5>Computers aren't really that dumb, are they?</h5>

	<p>In April, I used my computer to complete and file my taxes (because when it comes to taxes, I don't really know what I'm doing). Sure, I gave it some necessary information, but it compiled it for me in such a way that would make the IRS happy. I couldn't have done it myself. Another thing I can't do myself is make a list of the movies that Arnold Schwarzenegger has appeared in. Seeing as how I can only think of a handful (most of which are the Terminator movies), my computer would undoubtedly do a better job than I. Why then, can't my computer tell me what Schwarzenegger and his "Twins" co-star, Danny DeVito, are doing in the following photo?</p>

	<p>Computers are considered omnipotent juggernauts of processing power but the truth is, they're pretty dumb. They are the undisputed chess champions of the world, but struggle with basic English. IBM's Watson supercomputer defeated two top <span class="italic">Jeopardy!</span> contestants a couple years ago, but for the clue "What grasshoppers eat," Watson answered: "kosher." For all of Watson's computing power, for all of its brawny bits (and bytes), it looked pretty silly.</p>

	<p>Consider how difficult it is to get a computer to do just about anything. For instance, what if we were physics teachers and as a last task before summer break, we needed to get a class average for the final exam. In order to do that, we might feed the computer the following code:</p>
