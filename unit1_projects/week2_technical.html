	<p>Margins, borders, and padding are pretty sweet. But in order to understand the concepts of those and how they operate with HTML and CSS, we first have to lay some groundwork: </p>

	<ol>
	<li>All HTML elements can be thought of as boxes</li>
	<li>Take a look at #1 again... think about it. Everything. This list I'm writing in right now is a rectangular box. The header above it is a box and the footer at the bottom is a box. Heck, this entire web page is one big box! </li>
	<li>Now that we know a web page is nothing but boxes, we have to arrange them so that they look nice and pretty for users. We don't want people getting sick when they're looking at our pages.</li>
	</ol> 

	<p>Now that we know the basics, let's refer to The CSS Box Model. Without going rogue technical on you, let's just say that the box model is a massive box that hugs the little HTML boxes and consists of margins, borders, and padding. The images below give a great visual representation (thanks W3 Schools and css-tricks.com!) Now, what exactly are these three?</p>
