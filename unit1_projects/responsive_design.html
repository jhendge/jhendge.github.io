	<p>Have you ever been to college? Ever furnished an apartment on a tight budget? Ever felt the burning to desire to munch on Swedish meatballs at 11:30 in the morning? Then you've been to that wonderful <span class="blue">blue</span> and <span class="yellow">yellow</span> box of fun, Ikea! That's right boys and girls, the amusement park known as Ikea has been serving up self-assembly furniture (<a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/allproducts/">checkout their awesome products!</a>) and dishing out Swedish meatballs in their cafeterias since 1943 (ok, I'm not actually sure they had cafeterias back in the 40s...)! </p>

	<p>While Ikea is known for its low cost, stylish furniture, it has also gained the reputation as the most difficult store to get out of. Between its signature curvy path, monstrous cafeteria, and eye-popping deals at every corner, a trip to Ikea could last up to seven or eight hours! That's right... seven or eight hours! In light of that, I have put together a few helpful tips that should make your next trip to Ikea more efficient!</p>

		<li>Stuff your pockets with meatballs - you'll need them for energy</li>
		<li>Focus!</li>
		<li>Leave...just leave</li>
