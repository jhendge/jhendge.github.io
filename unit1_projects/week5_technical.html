    <h5>Classes: what are they good for?</h5>

	<p>When I was about 10 years old, I had a shoebox filled with hundreds of super hero "baseball cards." Each card listed specific information pertaining to the hero such as name, height, weight, diet, super power, and weakness, similar to that of a basebcall card (except of course a baseball card would include things like batting average, RBIs, etc.). I used to love spreading the cards out on the floor and grouping them together by similar attributes, creating battle scenarios in my head I went along. As I received more and more cards on birthdays and holidays, it became increasingly difficult to keep track of everyone and the groups simply became too large to display on my floor. I needed a better way of keeping track of everything!</p>

	<p>Now that I'm a little bit older than 10 and have a renewed interest in super heroes (not really, but let's go with it!), I want to to use my newfound Ruby skills to organize my new cads. I suppose I could store my cards in their own separate hashes like this...</p>
