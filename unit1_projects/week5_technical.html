    <h5>Classes: what are they good for?</h5>

	<p>When I was about 10 years old, I had a shoebox filled with hundreds of super hero "baseball cards." Each card listed specific information pertaining to the hero such as name, height, weight, diet, super power, and weakness, similar to that of a basebcall card (except of course a baseball card would include things like batting average, RBIs, etc.). I used to love spreading the cards out on the floor and grouping them together by similar attributes, creating battle scenarios in my head I went along. As I received more and more cards on birthdays and holidays, it became increasingly difficult to keep track of everyone and the groups simply became too large to display on my floor. I needed a better way of keeping track of everything!</p>

	<p>Now that I'm a little bit older than 10 and have a renewed interest in super heroes (not really, but let's go with it!), I want to to use my newfound Ruby skills to organize my new cads. I suppose I could store my cards in their own separate hashes like this...</p>

	<p>Now I just need to create about 200 more hashes and I should be all set. Seems a little cumbersome, doesn't it? What happens when I get new cards? Should I just create more hashes? Maybe I should make one big hash to store them <span class="italic">all</span> in? What do I do when I want my superhoes to actually do stuff (you know, like methods!) like #eat, #travel, and #sleep? Well, by now I'm sure you've guessed that hashes might not be the most efficient solution to our storing and method-creating needs and that there's probably a simpler way. If that's what you're thinking, you are absolutely correct. And if you think that the simpler way has to do with creating a class for our superheroes, you are on to something.</p>

	<p>By creating a class, we can write methods once and have them run on all of our superhero objects. This is amazing and will save us a ton of time because now we don't have to write methods for each individual superhero. Think about how long that would've taken - Whew! So let's go ahead and start putting together our superhero class.</p>
