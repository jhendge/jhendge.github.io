    <h5>What is an Abstract Random thinking style?</h5>

	<p>I recently took the Gregorc Thinking Style test and found that I am an Abstract Random thinker which is awesome, but I have no clue what it means. In light of that, let's take a look at what my results indicate and I'll let you know whether I think it's accurate or not.</p>

<ol>
		<li>30% of the general population falls into the Abstract Random category</li>
		<li>You are a master of unusual organization systems that nobody else can understand (sounds a bit lofty to me... let's go to the next one)</li>
		<li>You experience big emotional swings and are very sensitive (ding ding ding!)</li>
		<li>You are person oriented (I like to think of myself this way)</li>
		<li>You take being challenged personally and are likely to to just "shut down" (agreed, "shut down" or "act out")</li>
		<li>Your world of reality is: the abstract world of feeling and emotion (true!)</li>
		<li>Your view of times is: the moment. You believe that time is articifical and restrictive (also very true)</li>
		<li>Your environmental preference would be one that is: emotionally and physically free, rich, active, and colorful (ok, this is getting a little creepy...)</li>
		<li>Your use of language is: metaphoric, filled with big gestures, body language, and very colorful (spot on)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>After reading the above results, I can definitely say that it almost perfectly describes how I see myself. Honestly, it's a little eerie. </p>

	<h5>What does this mean for Dev Bootcamp?</h5>

	<p>Knowing that I am an Abstract Random thinker, how can I best use this knowledge to help me get the most out of the Dev Bootcamp experience? First, I think it's imperative to note that I am a highly emotional guy with a tendency to analyze everything that is said and the manner in which it is delivered. I need to keep this in mind when interacting with others at DBC. If a pairing session doesn't go particularly well or if I've just had a rough day completing work, I need to be cognizant of my feelings and act in a manner that is appropriate. This is something that I've had to practice for years.</p>

	<p>In addition, because I have a non-competitive nature and tend to want to sit and analyze the heck out of everything, I need to be aware of this and more carefully manage my time. I find I lose sight of the big picture and focus on one minute detail until the clock starts counting down and I realize I have a ton more to do. Case in point: I spent entirely too much time on the solo challenge this week and didn't leave adequate time for this blog post, thus I now find myself rushing when really, I would love to spend an extra day or so researching this thinking style. Oh well, maybe next week I'll add a section to the blog and title it, "trials and tribulations of an Abstract Random thinker" :)</p>
