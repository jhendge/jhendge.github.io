	<h3><span class="italic"><u>Post #1 - Three Stellar Websites</u></span></h3>

	<h5>(1) --Vimeo--</h5>

	<p>Vimeo has all of the shine, polish, and design that YouTube never will (of course, YouTube doesn't necessary need it). When it comes to video sharing websites, Vimeo certainly wins the award for "best dressed." From its wild homepage mural to its meticulous design elements (logos, fonts, colors, links, etc.) and layout, Vimeo demands from itself what it asks of its contributors: beauty. In this respect, Vimeo has achieved its goal.</p> 

	<p>But not only is it well-designed, it is easy to navigate and use. The search bar at the top might be a bit intimidating at first ("how do I know what to search if I don't know what's on this site?"), so Vimeo provides "Staff Picks" right on the homepage to spur creativity. If a user wants to contribute, Vimeo makes the sign up, logging in, and video uploading process seamless. Because the site wants to continue to increase the size of its community, it has allowed the user to be an active member in as few clicks as possible. If you haven't been to vimeo.com before, check it out! In fact, you could just <a href="http://www.vimeo.com">click here!</a></p>

	<h5>(2) --Techmeme--</h5>

	<p>I'll write this section of my post the way Techmeme would want me to write it: simply and concisely. </p>

	<p>Techmeme aggregates tech news from a number of publications (check out the <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/lb">leaderboard</a>) and compiles the top stories on its site. Aside from listing the news, there are a few frills. Scroll towards the bottom of the homepage and you will find listings for "Who's Hiring in Tech?" (pretty much the same companies all of the time) and "Upcoming Tech Events" (actually useful). That being said, I come here for tech news and Techmeme does a great job of providing just that.</p>

	<h5>(3) --Bank of America--</h5>

	<p>You don't have to rub your eyes, you read that right: Bank of America (BOA) has a stellar website. For an industry that is decidedly unsexy (and the banking industry certainly is), BOA has taken the process of learning about personal and corporate banking, finding the nearest branch or ATM, online banking, and about a hundred other things and made each one presentable and easily digestible. It seems simple, but actually pulling it off is an entirely different story. That is the true beauty of BOA's website. Take a <a href="http://www.bankofamerica.com">look.</a></p>
