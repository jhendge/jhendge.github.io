			<h3>Reaction</h3>
			<p class="first-letter">
				After watching <a href="http://www.http://vimeo.com/85001014">"Shereef's Fireside Chat,"</a> I felt so thrilled to be a part of Dev Bootcamp and invigorated to meet my cohort in person this July.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shereef describes the desire to have attendees come in with their proverbial apron on, ready to create/build/cook with their partner chefs and I really identified with that. After going through the traditional educational experience (kindergarten, grade school, high school, college, grad school), I still felt like I needed more. I was able to figure out the techniques necessary to achieve good grades but never felt passionate, never felt like I was doing more than consuming a product or experience. This feels different. I've invested my time, money, career, relationships, and more to make Dev Bootcamp a reality and I feel more than ready to put my apron on and start cooking.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, it was refreshing to hear Shereef outline the "imposter fear" - the fear that everyone knows more than you, is more capable than you, and you will soon be found out and identified as a fraud, an imposter - because that is certainly something I have experienced in the past. Being a week behind in my work due to an innocent admin snafu has amplified my fear, so hearing Shereef detail it made me a bit more at ease. I frequently have to remind myself that I'm not in this alone, that there are others that are behind in their work, and that I <span class="italic">can</span> do this!
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm excited to hit the ground running this July and make more out of this program than any other experience in my life. I owe it to myself and those I love to put all of myself into Dev Bootcamp. In light of that, I'm going to make more of an effort to personally connect with those in my cohort and to not be afraid to ask for help. By doing this, not only will I get more out of the program, but I think others will to.
