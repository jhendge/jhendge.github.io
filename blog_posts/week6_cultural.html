	<h3><span class="italic"><u>Post #5 - White Tech: Stereotype Threat and White Programmers</u></span></h3>

    <h5>What is this pervasive threat?</h5>

	<p><span class="italic">"Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group"</span> - Michael Inzlicht</p>


	<h5>I'm white and male. So what?</h5>

	<p>Whenever the topic of stereotypes comes up and I'm involved in the conversation, my first instinct is to slowly tip toe backwards out of the room and hide until the proverbial storm blows over. I mean, it's always been pretty awkward for myself, a white, middle class male to talk about the trials and tribulations of growing up in a condo in Lincoln Park, an affluent and trendy neighborhood on the northside of Chicago. What am I supposed to say? Am I supposed to reflect honestly about the fact that being white, male, and middle class (WMMC) is a steroetype in an of itself? Should I discuss how the assumptions associated with being WMMC (i.e. no personal problems, everything is taken care of, financial security, etc.) are actually detrimental and can adversely affect the growth and prosperity of said white males?</p>

	<p>I couldn't do that. I couldn't wax on about the expectations and built-in assumptions of what a white, middle class male's life is like in the 21st century because no matter how significant that may be to myself - after all, that <span class="italic">is</span> my daily reality - it will <span class="italic">always</span> seem trivial compared to long-standing batlles between say, the lack of women in tech (brought on by the stereotype that women are less technically inclined than men and are inferior in math, science, and engineering).</p>

	<p>In no way am I disagreeing with or complaining about this social reality. I understand it. I get it. And I'm actually lauding the fact that white, middle class males' issues generally take a backseat to other negative stereotypes. I just need to be fair in saying that there is also a price tag that comes with being me. Like I said, it's always pretty awkward talking about stereotypes...</p>

	<h5>The battle</h5>

	<p>When it comes to being WMMC and working as a programmer in the tech industry, a couple visuals come to mind:</p>

	<p><strong>Zuck</strong></p>

	<p><strong>Quintessial Nerdy/Crafty Programmer</strong></p>

	<div class="image"><img src="http://jhendge.github.io/unit1_projects/images/popcorn.jpg" alt="IMAGE.jpg"/></div>

	<p>For better or for worse, I perpetuate the above stereotype. No, I didn't create Facebook. Yes, I wish I did. Seriously though, I can't help but laugh because as I sit here and write this post, I'm wearing a blue t-shirt with a grey Nike zip hoodie and I'm eating Cap'n Crunch out of one of those disposable cone-shaped paper water cups. It's ridiculous. I'm one bad haircut (or beard trim) away from completely owning the programmer chic look.</p>

	<h5>The solution</h5>

	<p>In terms of escaping this stereotype or ameliorating it, I could change the way I dress. While that would appear to be effective from a physical standpoint, I would still be the same person underneath. The reason why this is important is because beyond the physical stereotype of white, middle class male programmers exists a stereotype that suggests that the tech workplace is one in which male programmers, or bros, have fun by connecting with one another and as a result, directly or indirectly marginalize women. Unlike the clothes that I wear, that <span class="italic">is</span> a stereotype I can and will actively work to dispel not only while at Dev Bootcamp, but also in my professional career afterwards.</p>

	<p>The way I see it - and you might find this to be utterly trite and/or trivial - people are people and no matter what gender they are or how they look or what they think, they should be treated as if I or you would want to be treated. If we don't want to be treated in a rude or aggressive manner, why would we do that to others? Stereotype threats exist everywhere and while they seem like huge, complicated puzzles to solve, we can all do our part by at least treating others with decency. It's amazing what that can do.</p>
