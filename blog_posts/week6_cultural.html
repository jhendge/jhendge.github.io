    <h5>What is this pervasive threat?</h5>

	<p><span class="italic">"Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group"</span> - Michael Inzlicht</p>

	<h5>I'm white and male. So what?</h5>

	<p>Whenever the topic of stereotypes comes up and I'm involved in the conversation, my first instinct is to slowly tip toe backwards out of the room and hide until the proverbial storm blows over. I mean, it's always been pretty awkward for myself, a white, middle class male to talk about the trials and tribulations of growing up in a condo in Lincoln Park, an affluent and trendy neighborhood on the northside of Chicago. What am I supposed to say? Am I supposed to reflect honestly about the fact that being white, male, and middle class is a steroetype in an of itself? </p>

	<p>I couldn't do that. I couldn't wax on about the expectations and built-in assumptions of what a white, middle class male's life is like in the 21st century because no matter how significant that may be to myself - after all, that <span class="italic">is</span> my faily reality - it will <span class="italic">always</span> be deemed 
	In no way am I disagreeing with or complaining about this social reality. I understand it. I get it. I just need to be fair in saying that there is also a price tag that comes with being me. Like I said, it's always pretty awkward talking about stereotypes...</p>
